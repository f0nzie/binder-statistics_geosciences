## Introduction

This is a step-by-step guide on how to turn your Jupyter notebooks into live applications by adding a remote virtual machine running in [my.binder.org](https://mybinder.org/). The virtual machine is automatically built in the background after you supply a list of the packages that your notebooks or scripts require. 

## Motivation

Although, my main objective was not writing, or develop, on how to convert Jupyter notebooks to running applications, but rather convert the Jupyter JSON format to [Rmarkdown](), and then be able to run them from remote sessions of [RStudio]() and [RShiny](), it was difficult to ignore the value that live Jupyter notebooks would bring to Python users. So, this is a by-product, or a side-effect, of my efforts of making Jupyter more reproducible through Rmarkdown.

# README

# Data Visualization & Statistics in the Geosciences 2019

UPDATE: The 2020+ versions of this class are hosted on a the following [course specific Github page](https://github.com/clasp423/data_vis_statistics_geosciences).

This repository contains the laboratory portion of a split upper level undergraduate / graduate class in Python on data visualization and statistics for geo &amp; space scientists. There are two branches hosted here from 2019 and 2018 versions of the course. 

The labs uploaded will be in Jupyter primarily and coded in Python 3.5+. However, most of the functions and methods should work in Python 2.7. If you do not have/know what Jupyter is - you can download Python/Jupyter from Anaconda or Canopy as a fully installed and interactive environment. This will support most if not all of the packages used in the labs and then you can navigate to Jupyter through Anaconda/Canopy.

Make sure you check out the [Frequently Asked Questions](https://github.com/abbyazari/data_vis_statistics_geosciences/blob/master/FAQ/FAQ.md) section as you go through the labs. 

Please see our liscense at the end of this readme. This class has been developed in collaboration between [Dr. Michael Liemohn](http://clasp.engin.umich.edu/people/liemohn) of the Climate & Space Sciences & Engineering department and [Abby Azari](https://abbyazari.github.io/). The 2019 version updated with the assistance of [Brian Swiger](https://github.com/briswi).
